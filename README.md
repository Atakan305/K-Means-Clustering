# K-Means-Clustering

# On Banknote Dataset
Calculated some statistical measures like mean, standard deviation. 

Then I visualized where our points were clustered and visualized again with our calculated measures. 
While doing all these, I set the pyplot sub-library from the matplotlib library as plt and used the plt.scatter command.

Then I did normalization process.
Final step, I defined 3 center on the points of dataset. 
With used sklearn library, graphed normalized data and clustered data in my code.

# On Happyscore Dataset
Using K-Means Clustering method on happyscore dataset. It's allowing over 110 countries.

First I downloaded the dataset from the Internet. Then in my first lines, I imported the data set using pandas library.

Then I calculated some statistical measures over the data and printed them out. 

Then I visualized the data on the graph and started clustering on them. 
I noticed there was 3 center in this data. So I put 3 point on the graph.
